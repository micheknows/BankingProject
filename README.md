# Banking

Banking is a Python application to illustrate Python concepts using a very implified version of a banking system.

## Requirements
This module requires logging and pickle which are packaged with Python3

## Usage
Run the Banking.py file.

After that point, everything is menu driven.  Simply type the number in front of the menu item you choose.

Because this is a very simplified version of a banking system, there are no actual logins.

If you choose the Customer Application, you will be required to enter your customer ID to identify yourself.  Before trying the Customer Application, you can try the Employee Applicaton to either create a customer account for yourself and note the ID or just view a list of all current customers and choose an ID from an already created customer.
If you choose the Employee Application, username and password logins are implied and not implemented.  You will be taken directly to the Employee Application where you can create and delete customers and accounts, or approve or deny services such as loans and credit cards.

As a customer, you can view your profile and view your active accounts and services.  You can make a deposit or withdrawal from any of your current accounts.  You can apply for loans or credit cards and wait for approval.

As an employee, you can view all customers, create new customers, or delete existing customers.  You can create new checking or savings accounts for customers or you can add fees to existing accounts.  You can also view a list of services (loans and credit cards) for which customers have applied and you can choose to wait on those or approve or deny them.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.  Remember that this application is a mock simplified application and is not intended to be functional for actual use, but is instead designed to be a demonstration of Python concepts.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
